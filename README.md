# Test_Task_Voytsekhovskiy
Here's my Test Task. For Task 1 you can find three required test suites in the test_task folder, they're written on Python with the use of in-built requests library and Pytest (requirements.txt is in there too).
For Task 2 and 3 the asnwers are in the .txt files (since the task said "plain text" i chose the most plain of text formats) with corresponding names in the main folder.
